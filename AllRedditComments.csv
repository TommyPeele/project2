They constantly insult/mock you for having a different opinion and all up vote each other. I report them sometimes and check back later see their childish comments have 15+ upvotes while mine are buried and are still not removed. The fact their comment sits there so long gets others to just brigade comments they don't like further down and continue to insult the OP of the comment further down the thread. I think its time you don't just remove the one uncivil comment but remove the further ones in the thread that are usually much harsher. I also think if there is a user constantly making uncivil comments they should be banned. I've seen the same users saying stuff like 'go back to your safe space' name calling etc. 20 times and yet they are still freely allowed to post and insult on this sub.

But part of being professional journalists is that they try to be unbiased in their day-to-day news coverage.  Even in heavily Democratic Chicago the Tribune is well respected for in-depth accurate reporting.  But most papers at election time offer an endorsement from the editorial board that is clearly set as an opinion separate from their normal news coverage.  The Tribune endorsed Johnson which is very unusual for a bunch of Republicans.  USA Today ran an editorial rejecting Trump but said that among the editorial board they couldn't agree to endorse Clinton.
