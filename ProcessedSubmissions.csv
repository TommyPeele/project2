She's fairly right-wing in certain ways.  She lives by herself in a big city.  (Note the contradiction in those two preceding items.)  She's a fan of the Latin mass (the Catholic church switched to using the local language for masses in the early 60s).  She's a proponent of making contemporary buildings look Classical and strongly opposes proposals to build tall-ish buildings in the outer ring of Paris.
