She's fairly right-wing in certain ways.  She lives by herself in a big city.  (Note the contradiction in those two preceding items.)  She's a fan of the Latin mass (the Catholic church switched to using the local language for masses in the early 60s).

(It also turns out that this guy claims to have a very exclusive Somellier certification - so exclusive that no one can identify what organization awarded this title or find any record of this certification on the web that isn't linked to him personally.  Plus he says he has a PhD in Economics from the Harvard School of Business which is interesting both because no one can find him in any alum listings no one can find his thesis and the Business School doesn't award PhDs in Economics.  Veddy interesting.)"
